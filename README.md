# storm-analysis

The goal of the project was to analyze the tropical storm and hurricane data for the year 2005, and provide some statistical insight.

The dataset contains a list of storms stored in text files by their name.
Each storm has the following information:
- latitude
- longitude
- timestamp
- windspeed
- pressure

This information is read into a structure, connected by a doubly-linked list.

Based on analysis of the duration, windspeed, pressure and other parameters, we classify the storms into types such as storms, depression and hurricanes.
